# GemDart
Explore Ruby Gems

Finding Gems is not easy, I would like to write an app that picks Ruby Gems just like playing darts. This will make my job easier to find gems and write articles about them.

## Sinatra
Since Sinatra is my fav ruby framework, I will try to finish this project in Sinatra.


### TODO
- [ ] Check the RubyGems API http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#gem-metho
